# Flamedeck Trace Viewer

Welcome to Flamedeck! This project is building a web-based tool for viewing, analyzing, and collaborating on performance trace files (like those generated by various profilers). Think of it like Google Docs, but specifically designed for performance analysis.

The core web application allows you to upload, organize, view interactive flamegraphs and other visualizations, and discuss performance issues with your team directly within the context of the trace data.

This repository contains the source code for:

*   The frontend web application (`apps/client/`)
*   Backend services using Supabase (database schema, edge functions) (`supabase/`)
*   Shared code libraries (`packages/`)
*   A command-line interface (CLI) tool for uploading traces (`cli-rust/`)

## Installing the `flamedeck` CLI

The `flamedeck` CLI provides a convenient way to upload trace files to [Flamedeck](https://www.flamedeck.com) directly from your terminal or CI pipelines.

### Using Homebrew (Recommended for macOS)

1.  **Tap the Flamedeck repository (only needed once):**
    ```bash
    brew tap flamedeck-org/flamedeck
    ```
2.  **Install the CLI:**
    ```bash
    brew install flamedeck
    ```
    Homebrew installs the correct binary (Intel or Apple Silicon) and adds `flamedeck` to your PATH.

    *(Note: On first run, macOS Gatekeeper might show a security warning. To allow the app, find it (usually `/opt/homebrew/bin/flamedeck` or `/usr/local/bin/flamedeck`), right-click it in Finder, select "Open", and confirm.)*

### Using Install Script (Recommended for Linux / macOS CI)

Run the following command in your terminal. It automatically detects your OS/architecture, downloads the latest release, and installs it to `/usr/local/bin` (may prompt for sudo).

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flamedeck-org/flamedeck/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```
*(You can pipe to `sudo sh` instead if you prefer to grant sudo upfront).*

### Manual Installation (Linux, Windows, macOS)

1.  Go to the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/flamedeck-org/flamedeck/releases/latest) page.
2.  Download the appropriate binary for your system:
    *   `flamedeck-linux-x64`
    *   `flamedeck-macos-x64`
    *   `flamedeck-macos-arm64`
    *   `flamedeck-win-x64.exe`
3.  Rename the downloaded binary to `flamedeck` (or `flamedeck.exe` for Windows).
4.  Place the renamed binary in a directory that is part of your system's `PATH`. A common choice on Linux/macOS is `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
5.  Make it executable (Linux/macOS):
    ```bash
    chmod +x /path/to/your/flamedeck
    ```
6.  *(macOS Only): You might need to bypass Gatekeeper on first run (Right-click -> Open in Finder). See the Homebrew section for details.*

## CLI Usage Example

```bash
# Ensure API key is set (or use --api-key flag)
export FLAMEDECK_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

# Basic upload
flamedeck upload -s "My Performance Test" /path/to/my_trace.json

# More detailed upload with metadata
flamedeck upload \
  --scenario "User login flow - EU region" \
  --commit "a1b2c3d4e5f6" \
  --branch "feature/new-login" \
  --notes "Trace captured during peak load on staging server." \
  --folder-id "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  --metadata '{"ci_build_id": 456, "region": "eu-west-1", "test_variant": "A"}' \
  /path/to/another_trace.json

# Upload via stdin (requires --file-name)
cat /path/to/trace.json | flamedeck upload -s "Piped Test" -n "trace.json"

# Get help
flamedeck --help
flamedeck upload --help
```
