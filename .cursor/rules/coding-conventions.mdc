# Coding Conventions

- Always memoize by default (use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to ensure stable dependencies)
  - Also wrap exported components in `memo`
- Abstract large new pieces of functionality into separate hooks / components - component files should not be huge
- Always use named function declarations for components. E.g. `function MyComponent() {` not `const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {`
