description: 'Learn how to profile React Native applications and upload performance traces to Flamedeck for analysis.'
---

This guide explains how to capture performance profiles from your React Native application using `react-native-release-profiler` and seamlessly upload them to Flamedeck using the `@flamedeck/upload` package.

This is particularly useful for understanding the performance characteristics of your app as it runs on a real device or in a production-like environment.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install necessary packages">
    ```bash
    yarn add @flamedeck/upload react-native-release-profiler expo-file-system
    # or
    npm install @flamedeck/upload react-native-release-profiler expo-file-system
    ```

    - `@flamedeck/upload`: For uploading the trace to Flamedeck
    - `react-native-release-profiler`: For capturing the performance profile from your React Native app
    - `expo-file-system` (if using Expo, or a similar file system module for vanilla React Native): For reading the profile file from device storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get a Flamedeck API Key">
    You'll need an API key from Flamedeck to upload traces. You can obtain one from your [Flamedeck settings page](https://flamedeck.com/settings/api-keys).

    <Warning>
    Remember to replace `'YOUR_FLAMEDECK_API_KEY'` in the code example with your actual key.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

## Integration Steps

The core logic involves starting the profiler, executing the code you want to measure, stopping the profiler, reading the generated trace file, and then uploading it.

### Example Implementation

Here's a function demonstrating these steps. You can adapt this and trigger it, for example, from a button press in your development builds or testing scenarios.

```typescript
import { Alert } from 'react-native';
import { UploadError, UploadOptions, uploadTraceToApi } from '@flamedeck/upload';
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'; // For Expo projects
import { startProfiling, stopProfiling } from 'react-native-release-profiler';

// Helper function to convert base64 to ArrayBuffer
const base64ToArrayBuffer = (base64: string): ArrayBuffer => {
  const binaryString = atob(base64); // atob is available in React Native
  const len = binaryString.length;
  const bytes = new Uint8Array(len);
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    bytes[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return bytes.buffer;
};

// Function to capture and upload a profile
const captureAndUploadProfile = async () => {
  Alert.alert('Profiling Started', 'An operation is now being profiled.');
  try {
    startProfiling();

    // --- Your Code to Profile Starts ---
    // Example: Simulate a heavy computation or a specific app flow
    // Replace this with the actual operations you want to measure
    for (let i = 0; i < 50000000; i++) {
      // This loop will take some time
    }
    // --- Your Code to Profile Ends ---

    const profilePath = await stopProfiling(true); // true to auto-generate a file name

    if (profilePath) {
      const apiKey = 'YOUR_FLAMEDECK_API_KEY'; // Replace with your actual API key
      const fileUri = `file://${profilePath}`;

      const fileInfo = await FileSystem.getInfoAsync(fileUri);
      if (!fileInfo.exists) {
        throw new Error('Trace file does not exist at the reported path.');
      }
      if (fileInfo.size === 0) {
        throw new Error('Trace file is empty. Profiling might not have captured data.');
      }

      const base64Data = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(fileUri, {
        encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64,
      });
      if (!base64Data) {
        throw new Error('Failed to read trace file as base64.');
      }

      const traceData = base64ToArrayBuffer(base64Data);
      if (traceData.byteLength === 0) {
        throw new Error(
          'Converted ArrayBuffer is empty. Problem with base64 conversion or original data.'
        );
      }

      const fileName = profilePath.substring(profilePath.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);

      const options: UploadOptions = {
        apiKey: apiKey,
        traceData: traceData,
        fileName: fileName,
        scenario: 'React Native Performance Profile', // Customize as needed
        notes: 'Trace captured from a React Native app using react-native-release-profiler.',
        public: false, // Set to true if you want the trace to be publicly accessible
      };

      const result = await uploadTraceToApi(options);
      Alert.alert(
        'Upload Successful',
        `Trace uploaded!\nID: ${result.id}\nView: ${result.viewUrl}`
      );
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Profiling Failed', 'Could not get profile path.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Profiling or Upload Error:', error);
    let alertMessage = 'An unexpected error occurred.';
    if (error instanceof UploadError) {
      alertMessage = `Flamedeck Upload Error: ${error.message} (Status: ${error.status})`;
      if (error.details) console.error('Flamedeck Details:', error.details);
    } else if (error instanceof Error) {
      alertMessage = error.message;
    }
    Alert.alert('Error', alertMessage);
  }
};
```

## Key Implementation Notes

<Note>
**File System Access**: The example uses `expo-file-system` for Expo projects. If you're using vanilla React Native, you'll need to use a different file system library like `react-native-fs`.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Development vs Production**: Consider adding environment checks to only enable profiling in development or specific testing builds to avoid impacting production performance.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**API Key Security**: Never hardcode your API key in production builds. Use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms to handle API keys safely.
</Warning>

## Usage Tips

1. **Trigger Profiling**: You can trigger the `captureAndUploadProfile` function from a button press, gesture, or specific app event
2. **Profile Specific Flows**: Replace the example loop with the actual user flows or operations you want to profile
3. **Customize Metadata**: Add relevant metadata like user ID, app version, or device information to help with analysis
4. **Error Handling**: The example includes comprehensive error handling for common issues like empty files or upload failures

## Next Steps

Once you've uploaded your React Native traces to Flamedeck, you can:

- Analyze performance bottlenecks in your app
- Compare performance across different devices or app versions
- Share traces with your team for collaborative debugging
- Set up automated profiling in your CI/CD pipeline
