The `flamedeck` command-line interface (CLI) provides a powerful and convenient way to upload trace files to Flamedeck directly from your terminal or within your CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (Recommended for macOS)

1. **Tap the Flamedeck repository (only needed once):**
   ```bash
   brew tap flamedeck-org/flamedeck
   ```

2. **Install the CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install flamedeck
   ```
   
   Homebrew installs the correct binary (Intel or Apple Silicon) and adds `flamedeck` to your PATH.

<Note>
On first run, macOS Gatekeeper might show a security warning. To allow the app, find it (usually `/opt/homebrew/bin/flamedeck` or `/usr/local/bin/flamedeck`), right-click it in Finder, select "Open", and confirm.
</Note>

### Using Install Script (Recommended for Linux / macOS CI)

Run the following command in your terminal. It automatically detects your OS/architecture, downloads the latest release, and installs it to `/usr/local/bin` (may prompt for sudo).

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flamedeck-org/flamedeck/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

<Tip>
You can pipe to `sudo sh` instead if you prefer to grant sudo upfront.
</Tip>

### Manual Installation (Linux, Windows, macOS)

1. Go to the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/flamedeck-org/flamedeck/releases/latest) page on GitHub.
2. Download the appropriate binary for your system:
   - `flamedeck-linux-x64`
   - `flamedeck-macos-x64`
   - `flamedeck-macos-arm64`
   - `flamedeck-win-x64.exe`
3. Rename the downloaded binary to `flamedeck` (or `flamedeck.exe` for Windows).
4. Place the renamed binary in a directory that is part of your system's `PATH`. A common choice on Linux/macOS is `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
5. Make it executable (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/your/flamedeck
   ```

<Note>
**macOS Only**: You might need to bypass Gatekeeper on first run (Right-click -> Open in Finder).
</Note>

## Basic Usage

The primary command for uploading traces is `flamedeck upload`.

### Prerequisites

<Warning>
**API Key Required**: You need a Flamedeck API key with `trace:upload` scope. You can provide this using the `--api-key` flag or by setting the `FLAMEDECK_API_KEY` environment variable.
</Warning>

```bash
export FLAMEDECK_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Uploading a File

To upload a trace file, specify the scenario description (`-s` or `--scenario`) and the path to your trace file:

```bash
flamedeck upload -s "My Performance Test" /path/to/my_trace.json
```

### Uploading from stdin

You can also pipe trace data directly to the CLI. When reading from stdin, you **must** provide a filename using the `-n` or `--file-name` flag:

```bash
cat /path/to/trace.json | flamedeck upload -s "Piped Test" -n "trace.json"
```

## Available Options

The `upload` command accepts several options to add metadata and control the upload behavior:

<ParamField path="file_path" type="string">
  (Positional argument) Path to the trace file. If omitted, the CLI reads from stdin.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-k, --api-key" type="string">
  Your Flamedeck API key. Overrides the `FLAMEDECK_API_KEY` environment variable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-n, --file-name" type="string" required>
  The original filename of the trace. **Required** when reading from stdin.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-s, --scenario" type="string" required>
  A descriptive name for the scenario this trace represents (e.g., "User login", "Data processing job").
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-c, --commit" type="string">
  The Git commit SHA associated with this trace.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-b, --branch" type="string">
  The Git branch name associated with this trace.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--notes" type="string">
  Free-form text notes to attach to the trace.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--folder-id" type="string">
  The UUID of an existing folder to upload the trace into.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--metadata" type="string">
  A JSON string containing custom key-value metadata to associate with the trace.
  
  Example: `--metadata '{"ci_build_id": 456, "region": "eu-west-1"}'`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--public" type="boolean">
  If specified, makes the uploaded trace publicly viewable by anyone with the link. By default, traces are private.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--supabase-url" type="string">
  Overrides the default Supabase functions base URL. (For advanced use or self-hosting).
</ParamField>

## Detailed Example

Here's an example demonstrating several options:

```bash
flamedeck upload \
  --scenario "User login flow - EU region" \
  --commit "a1b2c3d4e5f6" \
  --branch "feature/new-login" \
  --notes "Trace captured during peak load on staging server." \
  --folder-id "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  --metadata '{"ci_build_id": 456, "region": "eu-west-1", "test_variant": "A"}' \
  --public \
  /path/to/another_trace.json
```

This command uploads `/path/to/another_trace.json`, associates it with the specified commit and branch, adds notes, places it in a folder, attaches custom metadata, and makes it publicly accessible.
