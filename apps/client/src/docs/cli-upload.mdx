# Using the CLI to Upload Traces

The `flamedeck` command-line interface (CLI) provides a powerful and convenient way to upload trace files to Flamedeck directly from your terminal or within your CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (Recommended for macOS)

1.  **Tap the Flamedeck repository (only needed once):**
    ```bash
    brew tap flamedeck-org/flamedeck
    ```
2.  **Install the CLI:**
    ```bash
    brew install flamedeck
    ```
    Homebrew installs the correct binary (Intel or Apple Silicon) and adds `flamedeck` to your PATH.

    *(Note: On first run, macOS Gatekeeper might show a security warning. To allow the app, find it (usually `/opt/homebrew/bin/flamedeck` or `/usr/local/bin/flamedeck`), right-click it in Finder, select "Open", and confirm.)*

### Using Install Script (Recommended for Linux / macOS CI)

Run the following command in your terminal. It automatically detects your OS/architecture, downloads the latest release, and installs it to `/usr/local/bin` (may prompt for sudo).

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flamedeck-org/flamedeck/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```
*(You can pipe to `sudo sh` instead if you prefer to grant sudo upfront).*

### Manual Installation (Linux, Windows, macOS)

1.  Go to the [**Latest Release**](https://github.com/flamedeck-org/flamedeck/releases/latest) page on GitHub.
2.  Download the appropriate binary for your system:
    *   `flamedeck-linux-x64`
    *   `flamedeck-macos-x64`
    *   `flamedeck-macos-arm64`
    *   `flamedeck-win-x64.exe`
3.  Rename the downloaded binary to `flamedeck` (or `flamedeck.exe` for Windows).
4.  Place the renamed binary in a directory that is part of your system's `PATH`. A common choice on Linux/macOS is `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
5.  Make it executable (Linux/macOS):
    ```bash
    chmod +x /path/to/your/flamedeck
    ```
6.  *(macOS Only): You might need to bypass Gatekeeper on first run (Right-click -> Open in Finder). See the Homebrew section for details.*

## Basic Usage

The primary command for uploading traces is `flamedeck upload`.

### Prerequisites

*   **API Key**: You need a Flamedeck API key with `trace:upload` scope. You can provide this using the `--api-key` flag or by setting the `FLAMEDECK_API_KEY` environment variable.
    ```bash
    export FLAMEDECK_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

### Uploading a File

To upload a trace file, specify the scenario description (`-s` or `--scenario`) and the path to your trace file:

```bash
flamedeck upload -s "My Performance Test" /path/to/my_trace.json
```

### Uploading from stdin

You can also pipe trace data directly to the CLI. When reading from stdin, you **must** provide a filename using the `-n` or `--file-name` flag:

```bash
cat /path/to/trace.json | flamedeck upload -s "Piped Test" -n "trace.json"
```

## Available Options

The `upload` command accepts several options to add metadata and control the upload behavior:

*   `file_path`: (Positional argument) Path to the trace file. If omitted, the CLI reads from stdin.
*   `-k, --api-key <API_KEY>`: Your Flamedeck API key. Overrides the `FLAMEDECK_API_KEY` environment variable.
*   `-n, --file-name <FILE_NAME>`: The original filename of the trace. **Required** when reading from stdin.
*   `-s, --scenario <SCENARIO>`: (Required) A descriptive name for the scenario this trace represents (e.g., "User login", "Data processing job").
*   `-c, --commit <COMMIT_SHA>`: The Git commit SHA associated with this trace.
*   `-b, --branch <BRANCH_NAME>`: The Git branch name associated with this trace.
*   `--notes <NOTES>`: Free-form text notes to attach to the trace.
*   `--folder-id <FOLDER_ID>`: The UUID of an existing folder to upload the trace into.
*   `--metadata <JSON_STRING>`: A JSON string containing custom key-value metadata to associate with the trace.
    *   Example: `--metadata '{"ci_build_id": 456, "region": "eu-west-1"}'`
*   `--public`: If specified, makes the uploaded trace publicly viewable by anyone with the link. By default, traces are private.
*   `--supabase-url <URL>`: Overrides the default Supabase functions base URL. (For advanced use or self-hosting).

### Detailed Example

Here's an example demonstrating several options:

```bash
flamedeck upload \
  --scenario "User login flow - EU region" \
  --commit "a1b2c3d4e5f6" \
  --branch "feature/new-login" \
  --notes "Trace captured during peak load on staging server." \
  --folder-id "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  --metadata '{"ci_build_id": 456, "region": "eu-west-1", "test_variant": "A"}' \
  --public \
  /path/to/another_trace.json
```

This command uploads `/path/to/another_trace.json`, associates it with the specified commit and branch, adds notes, places it in a folder, attaches custom metadata, and makes it publicly accessible.
