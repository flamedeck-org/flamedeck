# Api Keys

## Obtaining an API Key

To interact with the FlameDeck API, you first need an API key. Follow these steps to generate one:

1.  **Navigate to Settings:** Log in to your FlameDeck account and go to the [API Keys settings page](/settings/api-keys).
2.  **Create New Key:** Click on the "Create New API Key" button.
3.  **Name Your Key:** Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "CI/CD Pipeline Key", "Local Dev Key") to help you identify its purpose later.
4.  **Select Scopes:** Choose the permissions (scopes) that this key will have. See the section below for more details on scopes. It's best practice to grant only the necessary permissions.
5.  **Generate & Copy:** Click "Generate Key". Your new API key will be displayed **only once**. Make sure to copy it immediately and store it securely. **Do not share your API key or commit it to version control.**

## Understanding Scopes

Scopes define the specific actions an API key is allowed to perform. When creating a key, you select the scopes it should have. This follows the principle of least privilege, enhancing security.

Currently, the following scopes are available:

- `trace:upload`: Allows the API key to upload new trace files via the `/api/upload-trace` endpoint.
- `trace:download`: Allows the API key to download trace data via the `/api/download-trace` endpoint.

_More scopes may be added in the future as API functionality expands. Remember to keep your API keys confidential and manage their scopes appropriately._
